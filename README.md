# Filmolino SlideScanner
The Filmolino SlideScanner is a device that makes it easy to scan slides in magazines fully automated using a modified slide projector and a digital camera. It controls the slide projector and a digital camera using a cable release or an infrared remote control (Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus, Minolta). New cable releases and IR controls can easyily be added to the software. 
 
Thanks to the [M5StampC3 from M5Stack](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-controllers/products/fire-iot-development-kit) using a ESP-32 core together with 16M Flash, 8M PSRAM and a built in 3.7V/500mAh Lithium battery it is also possible to use the device without a power supply and remote control the SlideScanner through a web interface over WiFi. The scanner has it's own access point to which you can connect.

The Filmolino SlideScanner is completely open source, so you can easy build your own!
